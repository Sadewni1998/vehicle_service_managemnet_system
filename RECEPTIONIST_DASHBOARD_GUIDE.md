# Receptionist Dashboard - Booking Management

## Overview

The Receptionist Dashboard displays all bookings from the `booking` table in the database for today's date. Receptionists can view, approve, reject, and mark bookings as arrived.

## Database Table: `booking`

The receptionist dashboard reads from the `booking` table which has the following key fields:

```sql
CREATE TABLE booking (
    bookingId INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
    vehicleNumber VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    vehicleType VARCHAR(100),
    fuelType VARCHAR(50),
    vehicleBrand VARCHAR(100),
    vehicleBrandModel VARCHAR(100),
    manufacturedYear YEAR,
    transmissionType VARCHAR(50),
    bookingDate DATE NOT NULL,
    timeSlot VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    serviceTypes JSON,
    specialRequests TEXT,
    status ENUM('pending', 'confirmed', 'in_progress', 'completed', 'cancelled', 'arrived'),
    arrivedTime TIME NULL,
    customerId INT NULL,
    createdAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updatedAt TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE KEY unique_time_slot (bookingDate, timeSlot)
);
```

## Status Workflow

The receptionist can manage bookings through the following status transitions:

1. **pending** â†’ **confirmed** (Approve)
   - Receptionist reviews and approves the booking
2. **pending** â†’ **cancelled** (Reject)
   - Receptionist rejects the booking
3. **confirmed** â†’ **arrived** (Mark Arrived)
   - Customer arrives at the service center
   - System captures the arrival time
